	<h1>Ordamo SDK Demo App</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the SDK demo app. This page demonstrates the major features of the SDK.</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The Ordamo V3 system is a ceiling-mounted device that projects an interactive surface onto a table. This is used simultaneously
		by several people, for example at the "inamo" series of interactive restaurants.</p>
	<p>The frontend software running on the V3 units is a modular HTML5 application. A wrapper program called the apphost loads
		and displays apps. Each app is simply an HTML page.</p>
	<p>The Ordamo V3 SDK is a package designed to ease the process of developing apps. In particular, it allows apps to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>declare what kind of content the app requires - this is used to create a CMS interface for the app</li>
		<li>load content from the CMS server at runtime</li>
		<li>find out where plates are positioned on the table in order to avoid drawing content in places where it will be covered
			by a plate</li>
		<li>save state, so that if a user leaves the app they can resume where they left off on returning</li>
		<li>during development, mock out the above features so that developers can test an app without access to a V3 unit or CMS server
	</ul>
	<h2>Getting started</h2>
	<p>This file you're looking at right now is a V3 app. It's built using <a href="http://brunch.io/">Brunch</a> because Brunch
		is a great built tool for small apps. The thing that makes it a V3 app is its use of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ordamo-v3-sdk">ordamo-v3-sdk</a>		NPM package, defined as a dependency in package.json. You don't have to use Brunch, or even node.js to make a V3 app -
		but we recommend that apps are created by copying this demo app template. It's a pattern that we've found to work well.</p>
	<p>The best way to get started is to read through the source code of this app. It's well commented.</p>
	<p>You may find these scripts useful, run them from a command window in the same folder as the app's package.json:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>npm start</code> - launches a development server at http://localhost:3333/ that serves this documentation page. It
			watches your source folder and whenever you change anything it recompiles the code and refreshes the browser window</li>
		<li><code>npm run release</code> - make a release build. The newly created build file is copied to <code>release/app-name--version.js</code></li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Working with content</h2>
	<p>SDK apps define the content that they accept through a "content schema". TODO: finish this doc</p>

	<h3>Embedding static assets in LESS</h3>
	<p>Finally, a note that it is good practice if an image is small and does not change that it be embedded in the stylesheet
		in order to reduce the number of requests made ot the server. This is a demo of an image embedded using the data-uri()
		function in app.less.</p>
