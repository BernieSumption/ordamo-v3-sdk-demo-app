	<h1>Ordamo SDK Demo App</h1>
	<p>Welcome to the SDK demo app. This page demonstrates the major features of the SDK.</p>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>The Ordamo V3 system is a ceiling-mounted device that projects an interactive surface onto a table. This is used simultaneously
		by several people, for example at the "inamo" series of interactive restaurants.</p>
	<p>The frontend software running on the V3 units is a modular HTML5 application. A wrapper program called the apphost loads
		and displays apps. Each app is simply an HTML page.</p>
	<p>The Ordamo V3 SDK is a package designed to ease the process of developing apps. It allows apps to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>declare what kind of content the app requires - this is used to create a CMS interface for the app</li>
		<li>load content from the CMS server at runtime</li>
		<li>find out where plates are positioned on the table to avoid drawing content in places where it will be covered by a plate</li>
		<li>save state, so that if a user leaves the app they can resume where they left off on returning</li>
		<li>during development, mock out the above features so that developers can test an app without access to a V3 unit or CMS server
	</ul>
	<h2>Getting started</h2>
	<p>There are two main sources of information on how to build a V3 app.</p>
	<p>This file you're looking at right now is a V3 app. It's built using <a href="http://brunch.io/">Brunch</a> because Brunch
		is a great build tool for small apps, but it could be built with any other frontend build tool, or without any build tool
		at all. We recommend that apps are created by copying this demo app template. It's a pattern that we've found to work well.
		The thing that makes this page a V3 app is its use of the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ordamo-v3-sdk">ordamo-v3-sdk</a>		NPM package, defined as a dependency in package.json.
	</p>
	<p>The best way to get started developing a V3 app is to read through the source code of this app, and of the ordamo-v3-sdk
		package, both of which are developed in TypeScript and well commented. It's well commented.</p>
	<p>You may find these scripts useful, run them from a command window in the same folder as the app's package.json:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>npm start</code> - launches a development server at http://localhost:3333/ that watches your source folder and whenever
			you change anything it recompiles the code and refreshes the browser window</li>
		<li><code>npm run release</code> - runs tests and makes a release build. The newly created build file is copied to the <code>release</code>			folder</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Limitations of apps</h2>
	<p>Apps are created using browser technologies, so it's easy to forget that apps are not entirely like websites. Here are some
		important differences to bear in mind:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Apps are used by multiple people at a time. This has many implications, for example you can't use the HTML &lt;select&gt;
			control, because it closes automatically when you click anywhere outside the dropdown box. With multiple people using
			the app at the same time, if one person opened a &lt;select&gt; control it might be closed by someone else clicking on
			a button elsewhere on the screen. If you're using 3rd party libraries and frameworks, make sure that they don't have behaviour
			that assumes a single user. As a rule of thumb, you'll be OK with low-level frameworks that ehhance JavaScript's functionality,
			like React, jQuery and underscore. UI frameworks that include pre-built widgets like jQuery UI probably won't work as
			expected.
		</li>
		<li>Apps are controlled by touch only - mice are single-user devices and don't play well with multi-user environments. Since
			many development machines aren't touch enabled, the SDK will automatically convert mouse events to touch events for you.
			The SDK will also silence the original mouse events, so click listeners will not work even on a desktop machine with a
			mouse. This is to prevent you from accidentally using functionality that won't be available in a real installation. In
			your app code, you should listen to touchstart, touchmove and touchend events. Use touchstart instead of click.</li>
		<li>There are two kinds of app, fullscreen and normal. Fullscreen apps appear above all other content, and can receive touch
			events.
			<li>Normal apps are simpler to develop because they appear underneath an interactive overlay that displays spotlights above
				plate locations, and shows a navigation menu. The cost of this is that they can't receive touch events, and can only
				perform interaction through the events dispatched by <code>sdkInstance.onInteractions();</code>.</li>
			<li>Fullscreen apps appear above all other content, so can receive touch events. They must render their own plate spotlights
				if appropriate, and must provide an exit button that calls <code>sdkInstance.requestAppClose()</code>, <a
					href="#" id="request-app-close-button">like this one</a>.
			</li>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Working with content</h2>
	<p>SDK apps define the content that they accept through a file called <code>content-schema.json</code>. In principle you could
		create this file manually, but it's expected that app authors will use TypeScript and the <code>ordamo-v3-sdk</code> command
		line utility which provide validation of the schema during development. This demo app uses every available type of content,
		check out the schema definition in <code>app/content/schema.ts</code>.</p>
	<p>In addition to the schema, SDK apps have a file called <code>default-content.json</code> that provides some content matching
		the requirements define in the schema. In a live installation, if no custom content has been created in the CMS, this default
		content is shown to the users.</p>
	<p>Below is a demonstration of many of the options available. To see the full available options, the best source of documentation
		is the TypeScript definitions file at <code>{your project}/node_modules/ordamo-v3-sdk/lib/index.d.ts</code>. So for example,
		to see what optional are available on an image, check out the sdk.image function and see that it takes an ImageOptions
		object. Find the ImageOptions interface to see the documented parameters. If you use a TypeScript-aware editor like Visual
		Studio Code, it will automate this process for you and offer to auto-complete image options for you.</p>

		<table>
			<tr>
				<th id="content-image-title"></th>

					aspect ratio</td>
				<td colspan="2">Text has a min and max length, and can permit or prohibit line breaks.</td>
				<td colspan="2">Videos are supported in MP4, Ogg and WebM formats. Internally they are represented as images with isVideo:true set in

	<h3>Working with plate spot locations</h3>
	<p>When deployed in a live installation, the SDK will inform apps of the actual positions of plates on the table. In development,
		it generates mock data. Below is a live image of the current plate spots, see <code>drawPlateSpotLocations()</code> in
		<code>index.ts</code> to see how it's drawn. You can control the mock data using URL parameters, for example adding
		<a href="?plateSpots=4&amp;contentAreas=2" id="plate-spot-link">plateSpots=4&amp;contentAreas=2</a>** to the URL will cause
		more plate spots and content areas to be created.
	</p>
	<canvas id="plate-spot-canvas"></canvas>
	<p>** Recall that one of the app limitations documented above is that clicks don't work, you must use touch events. In order
		to make this link work, it is necessary to attach a touchstart listener to it. See the <code>setupClickableLink()</code>		function in <code>index.ts</code></p>
	<h3>Embedding static assets in LESS</h3>
	<p>Finally, a note that it is good practice if an image is small and does not change that it be embedded in the stylesheet
		to reduce the number of requests made to the server. This is a demo of an image embedded using the data-uri() function
		in app.less.</p>
