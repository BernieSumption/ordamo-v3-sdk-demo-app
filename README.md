# Ordamo V3 SDK demo app

A demo application that uses the `ordamo-v3-sdk package`. It demonstrates key featues of the
SDK and contains a configured development environment with scripts for running release builds,
unit tests and a local development server with live reloading.

To view the documentation, run `npm start` from the same folder as this file and go to

## Creating new SDK apps

This project can be used as a template for new Ordamo V3 apps. Copy the folder, then:

1. Edit package.json to alter the package name and version to be appropriate for your app.
2. Edit LICENSE.txt to have correct copyright and license information
3. Edit README.md (this file!) to remove these instructions and insert a description of your app.
